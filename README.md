The Cookers Nest
================

Welcome to The Cookers Nest, an application I'm creating to solve a very particular problem, and remember how to program in Qt.
Feel free to browse, fork, download, use it, etc. Since this is being made for studying purpose, I've released it under the GPL,
so, please abide to it.

What's the story, morning glory?
--------------------------------

I make Limoncello and Arancello, and they are good enough so that people actually like to buy them. And I do have *some* whay of
tracking via a Spreadsheet. So, how about I create a Qt application to make the exact same thing? Therefore I have some objectives here:

1. Remember how to program in Qt and brush up my skills (the last time I touched Qt was with Qt 4...)
2. Brush some C++. Been doing a lot of Python latelly and I would not like to loose my C++ skills.
3. Learn and teach something usefull on my [personal blog](https://jitprogramer.com). I'm bloging about all the steps to create a full appication (in portuguese).

So what's the GUI?
------------------
We will be working with basically 6 tabs:

Outro
-----
1. English is not my mother language, so please take this into account.
2. I'll keep updating this README file, during the development.
3. I **always** use a lot of branches, so if you want to keep track of the latest, always check the latest commited branch, at least during development.
